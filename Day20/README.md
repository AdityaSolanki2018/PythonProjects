🐍 What is this Project All About?
This project is Part 1 of a 2-part Snake Game series, where I recreate the classic Snake Game using Python's turtle module.

It’s only been 20 days into my Python learning journey, and I’m already building interactive games — how cool is that? 🎮🔥
This is a testament to how quickly you can start applying programming concepts to real-world fun!

🧠 What I Learned
So far in this project, I’ve learned and applied:

💡 Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods)

🐢 Python Turtle module for 2D graphics and movement

⏱️ Usage of modules like time to manage game timing

🔁 Game loops and key event handling

🧩 Code structuring across multiple files for better readability

Part 2 will include:

Food logic

Collision detection

Game over handling

Score tracking

Stay tuned for the full game in upcoming days! 🚀
