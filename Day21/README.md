# 🐍 Classic Snake Game – Python Turtle

This is a full implementation of the classic **Snake Game**, built using **Python** and the `turtle` graphics module.  
This is Part 2 of my Snake Game project for Day 22 of my **#100DaysOfPython** challenge.

## 🎮 Features

- ✅ Real-time gameplay loop using `while` loop and `ontimer`
- 🍎 Food spawning at random locations
- 🐍 Snake growth after eating food
- 💥 Wall collision detection (ends game)
- 🔁 Self-collision detection (ends game)
- 🧮 Score tracking with live updates
- 🪦 "Game Over" display when conditions are met

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, encapsulation)
- Working with `turtle` graphics to build interactive apps
- Implementing collision detection and game logic
- Managing screen updates and animation timing
- Code structuring and modular file organization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- `turtle`
- `time`, `random`
