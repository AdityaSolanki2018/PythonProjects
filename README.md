# 🐍 100 Days of Python Projects

Welcome to my journey of building **100+ Python projects in 100 days**!  
This repository contains beginner to intermediate level projects to reinforce my Python skills, one project at a time.

> 💡 I'm learning Python by building — from basics to real-world games and apps!
