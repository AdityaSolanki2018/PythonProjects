# 🐍 100 Days of Python Projects

Welcome to my journey of building **100+ Python projects in 100 days**!  
This repository contains beginner to intermediate level projects to reinforce my Python skills, one project at a time.

> 💡 I'm learning Python by building — from basics to real-world games and apps!

## 📈 What I’ve Gained So Far

- Stronger understanding of Python syntax, data types, and control flow
- Confidence in using `turtle`, `time`, and other built-in modules
- Applied Object-Oriented Programming in fun projects
- Organized code into modular, readable files
- Documented my learning with commit history and README files
