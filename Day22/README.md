# 🏓 Classic Pong Game in Python (Turtle)

A simple, clean, and fully playable version of the classic **Pong Game**, built using Python's `turtle` module.  
This project is part of my #100DaysOfPython journey, and is a solid step forward in mastering **OOP, game logic, and event handling**.

## 🎮 Game Features

- 🕹️ Two-player paddle controls:
  - Player 1: `W` / `S`
  - Player 2: `Up Arrow` / `Down Arrow`
- 🎯 Ball collision detection with walls and paddles
- 🧠 Scoreboard with win condition (first to 5 points)
- 🔄 Ball resets on scoring
- 🚀 Smooth screen updates using `tracer()` and `update()`

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` (built-in graphics)
- OOP (`Paddle`, `Ball`, `ScoreBoard` classes)

## ▶️ How to Play

1. Make sure Python is installed.
  
3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Controls:

  Left Paddle: W = Up | S = Down

  Right Paddle: ↑ = Up | ↓ = Down

🧠 What I Learned
* Writing and structuring multiple Python classes

* Real-time game loops with precise screen control

* Collision detection logic

* Handling keyboard events in Turtle

* Score tracking and win condition logic
