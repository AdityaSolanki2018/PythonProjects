📦 Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed. Then install pandas:

pip install pandas

# ▶️ How to Run
Clone the repo or download the files.

Make sure the image and CSV files are in the correct directory.

Run main.py:

python main.py
Enter state names into the popup as you play.

Type Exit anytime to end the game and generate a list of states you missed.

# 📊 Data Source
The 50_states.csv file contains state names and coordinates that help position text on the map. You can customize this for other maps or quizzes!

# 🧠 Future Enhancements (Ideas)
Add a timer for challenge mode

Include sound effects for correct/incorrect guesses

Add a scoring system

Turn it into a quiz for world geography or Indian states
